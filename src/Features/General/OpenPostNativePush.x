// Opening a saved post from the Gallery without losing your place.
//
// Instagram's router builds the single-post page itself: handing it
// instagram://media?id=<mediaPK>_<userPK> makes it push an IGSingleFeedViewController
// onto the feed tab's IGNavigationController, roughly 70-90ms later. That is the
// right page, but it lands on a stack behind the Gallery, so the old behaviour had
// to dismiss the Gallery to reveal it -- and dismissing is what loses your place.
//
// So we let the router do all the construction (nothing here knows how to build a
// feed page, and IG keeps that working across versions), then intercept the push
// and redirect the finished view controller onto the same invisible host stack the
// profile push uses. The result is a page that arrives with IG's own transition and
// pops back to the Gallery exactly where you left it.
//
// The interception window is armed immediately before the router is invoked and
// disarmed on the first capture, so the push hook is inert during normal browsing.
