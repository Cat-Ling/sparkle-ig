// one up first, so the open finishes a network round trip later than the call
// does: the BOOL variants answer "this was started", which is too early to
// announce. Anything that toasts on success must use this. `completion` runs on
// the main thread, once, whether the work was synchronous or not.
//
// `didLink` means the account was just backfilled onto the item, which already
// posted a toast of its own. A caller that would otherwise announce a plain
// "Opened profile" should stay quiet, so the two do not stack.
